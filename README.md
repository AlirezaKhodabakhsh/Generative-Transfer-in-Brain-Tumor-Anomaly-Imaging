# Anomaly Detection in Brain Tumor Imaging: Few-Shot Learning with Generative Models and Knowledge Transfer

## Overview
In the field of medical imaging, particularly brain tumor imaging, detecting anomalies accurately is crucial yet challenging. Current models often struggle or experience significant performance declines in scenarios with a "close distribution," where the differences between normal and abnormal samples are minimal.

This research proposes a novel approach using a score-based generalization model to generate semi-distributed aggregated anomaly data. The model is further refined to effectively distinguish these data from normal samples. Our method has undergone extensive quantitative and qualitative assessments to validate its effectiveness. 

The unique feature of our approach lies in its ability to perform near and normal distribution anomaly detection. This has been evaluated through comprehensive testing on various datasets in medical imaging applications. The results demonstrate a significant improvement over existing models and a systematic reduction in the performance gap typically observed in standard novelty detection methods and close distribution scenarios.
